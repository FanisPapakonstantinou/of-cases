Kudos to CFD-online user Bloerb for the blockMesh part.
Used polynomial properties from http://stepan.hostenko.com/polynomial-properties-of-water-for-openfoam-2-3/ so props here.
The results can be compared with the report from https://zies.hs-duesseldorf.de/Lehre/Abschlussarbeiten/Documents/BA2014REICH_Waermeuebertrager.pdf

The case should be made axis-symetric, but havent bothered with that.
